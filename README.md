# Modeling & Verification Homework #1

This repository is the starter for homework #1 of the course
["Modeling & Verification"](https://moodle.unige.ch/course/view.php?id=183)
at [University of Geneva](http://www.unige.ch).

## Environment

Please install the [environment](https://github.com/cui-unige/modeling-verification).

## Subject



## Rules

* We use [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com) for the homework.
* If for any reason you have trouble with the deadline,
  contact your teacher as soon as possible.
* Your source code (and tests) must pass all checks of `luacheck`
  without warnings or errors.
* Your tests must cover at least 80% of the source code (excluding test files).
* Your work will be tested in a dedicated environment, using `wercker`.
  You can always run all the tests on your code with the following command,
  from the root of your project (where the `wercker.yml` file is located):

  ```sh
  $ wercker build
  ```

## Evaluation

Evaluation follows the questions:
* do you have done anything at the deadline?
  (no: 0 points)
  * [ ] Done anything
* do you have understood and implemented all the required notions?
  (yes: 4 points for all, no: 2 points for none)
  * [ ] Reachability graph
  * [ ] Coverability graph
  * [ ] Place invariants
  * [ ] Transition invariants
* do you have understood and implemented corners cases of all the required
  notions?
  (yes: +2 point for all)
  * [ ] Reachability graph
  * [ ] Coverability graph
  * [ ] Place invariants
  * [ ] Transition invariants
* do you have correctly written and tested your code?
  (no: -0.5 point for each)
  * [ ] Coding standards
  * [ ] Tests
  * [ ] Code coverage
